# M07-Assessment Holiday Manager
- This Holiday Manager is meant to allow a user to add, remove, save, and view holidays in the list that has been created. 
- The Holiday Manager uses a pre generated list and webscraping to create a list of holidays from two years ago to two years in the future that will be loaded for the user. 
- In order to add or remove holidays the user must input the holiday name and then the date of the holiday in YYYY-MM-DD format. 
## Running the code
- There is a config.py file that I submitted on teams, this is needed to run the file and holds the file location of the menu text document, Json holidays that were prewritten, and the saved Json document which would hold the holidays procurred from the web scraping process. 
- Unfortunately I really struggled with the weather API and that will not be included in this file. 
- There is also a folder called Plans which holds the draw.io figure of how I wanted my code to run. 
- The file that would be run on the command line is the holiday_Main_Code.py file.
